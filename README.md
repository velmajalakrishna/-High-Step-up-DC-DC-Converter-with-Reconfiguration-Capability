High Step-up DC-DC Converter with Reconfiguration Capability
The proposed “High Step-up DC-DC Converter with Reconfiguration Capability” is simulated in MATLAB/Simulink and PSIM platform with an output voltage of 100 V and power rating 100 W.
The proposed converter has the following benefits over existing topologies:
1.	High voltage gain is achieved in both normal and faulty operation of converter. 
2.	Low voltage stress across power switches is achieved in both normal and faulty operation of converter. 
3.	The proposed converter topology provides uniform current sharing among power electronic switches, common grounding features, and also reduces the power handled by the power electronic devices using alternate paths, thereby improves the converter overall efficiency. 
4.	Input current continuous, high efficiency (>96.5%), some additional advantages of the proposed converter.

A Pdf file (state space averaging technique) is upload to understand how the control to output transfer function is drived for proposed converter
   
The matlab code attached in file "bode-plot matlab code" help draw bode plot of converter.

A excel file is attached (voltage-gain and voltage-stress graphs)to draw graphs of voltage-gain and volatge-stress versus duty cycle for various fault-tolerant  converter reported in literature.

Working operation:
The operation of the converter in continuous conduction mode (CCM), normal and with fault-tolerance operation were explained and necessary equations were derived. The CCM operation is verified through simulations results and hardware results for both normal and faulty operation.
 
Specifications of proposed converter:
L1 = 0.5mH L2 = 0.5mH switching frequency = 33 kHz C1 = 50uF C2 = 50uF C3 = 100uF 
Power = 100 W output voltage = 100V
Simulated Results: Some of the important simulated results are attached in pdf (simulation results.pdf).
Applications of proposed converter: The proposed converter is an excellent choice for many critical load applications such as Electric Vehicles, Medical devices, Data centres, Aerospace, Military applications and Renewable energy integration etc.
